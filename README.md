# Genetic Algorithm Optimization

This project implements a genetic algorithm to locate the global
minimum of a stochastic objective function.

## Methods
- Population-based evolutionary search
- Fitness-proportional selection
- One-point crossover with blending parameter
- Random mutation with boundary constraints

The algorithm is evaluated by comparing the best solution found
to the true global minimum of the function.

This project demonstrates core concepts in evolutionary computation
and optimization.
